### Description
This is a single player card game against a computer, where one draws cards until he/she attempts to reach a total value of 21 points.  

### Tech used / Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript (vanilla)

### Features
- Heavy DOM manipulation, as the actual HTML page is very barebones except for the buttons.
- Fast, simple game that runs seamlessly.

### Future Implementations
- Multiplayer
- Implementing split and double down to add more dynamics to an otherwise static/one rule game.
- Create DRY-er code and an easier-to-follow program structure.
